# GDP_Birthrate_Visualizer

In this project, I worked on downloading data from the World Bank to then create graphs that showed changes over time. In this case, I looked at the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Infant Mortality Rates (IMR) indicators in all babies and females. Through this project, there is a large correlation between the GDP of a country and the IMR of that same country. 

The file motiongraph_country.m creates a gif that shows all the countries and their IMR throughout the years. In motiongraph_pickacountry.m, it asked the user to pick a country they would like to look at and then tracks that country's marker throughout the years, also in a gif format. 

In pickacountry.m it also asks the user to choose a country and then creates a graph showing the trendline of each indicator (GDP, IMR, and Female IMR) for that country. 



The data in dataset.xlsx was taken from
