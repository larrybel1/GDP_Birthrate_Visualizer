# GDP_Birthrate_Visualizer

In this project, I worked on downloading data from the World Bank to then create graphs that showed changed over time. In this case I looked at the indicators of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Infant Mortality Rates (IMR) in all babies, and females. Through this projects, there seems to be a large corrilation between the GDP of a country and the IMR of that same country. 

The file motiongraph_country.m, it creates a gif that shows all the counrtires and their IMR through out the years. In motiongraph_pickcountry.m, it asked the user to pick a country they would like to look at and then tracks that countries marker thoughout the years, also in a gif formate. 




The data in dataset.xlsx was taken from 
https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators
The code files are of my own creation
